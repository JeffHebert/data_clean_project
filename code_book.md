Getting and Cleaning Data from Wearable Computers
===========
    
This document describes how to interpret data produced by my work in
the Coursera course on obtaining and cleaning data. The prefixes t and f indicate data is measured in the time domane (prefix t) or the frequency domain (prefix f). The suffexes X, Y, and Z indicate the direction of the meaurement in the forward/backward (suffex X), left/right (suffex Y), or up/down (suffex Z) directions.
